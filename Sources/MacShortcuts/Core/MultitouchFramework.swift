// Core/MultitouchFramework.swift
// This file loads Apple's hidden (private) MultitouchSupport framework at runtime.
//
// Why is this necessary? Apple's trackpad multitouch API is not public — there's no
// official Swift or Objective-C way to ask "how many fingers are touching the trackpad
// right now at the raw level." However, macOS itself uses an internal framework called
// MultitouchSupport for this purpose. This file finds that framework, loads it into
// memory at runtime, and pulls out the specific functions we need.
//
// If the framework isn't available (future macOS versions might move it), the app
// degrades gracefully — no crash, just no gesture detection.
